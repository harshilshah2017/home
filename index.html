	<h2>Bulldog</h2>
    <p class="center">
      For some odd reason, I find myself liking bulldogs. They are
      adorable and funny. I especially love their face. It makes me
      laugh so much.

	<h3>Great White Sharks</h3>
    
	<p class="center">When you hear Great White Sharks, fear strikes your heart. They are fast and have keen senses. They can grow upto 20ft long! People fear sharks, but they don't know that sharks don't prefer humans. They think that humans are a fish, but when they try humans, they understand that we are not fish. If you are ever confronted with a Great White, hit thier eye or lung to make them go away. I like them becuase they are ferocious and scary. </p>

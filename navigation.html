		<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          To get started, a GPS stands for Global Positioning
          System. It is an electronic version of a map. As of
          February 2012, 74% of smartphone users use location-based
          apps. This was 19% more users than in May 2011. This
          means that GPS are getting more popular while the usage
          of paper maps are decreasing. To use a GPS is more simple
          as you only need type the destination you want to go to
          and you will get a voice helper. Depending on the GPS you
          get, you can get more features.
        </p>
        
		<h1 id="gps">Function of the GPS</h1>
        <p>
          The job involves a device (GPS) and a satellite. To make
          a GPS work, you need to input the destination you want to
          go to and that&#39;s it. An automated voice does the rest.
          You just follow the voice and eventually, you will reach
          your destination. There are other functions on the GPS
          such as and electronic compass and scale. The GPS also
          gives you written directions and gives you the speed you
          are going at. They also tell you what time you will reach
          your destination.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a GPS, there are many features. You can book at a
          restaurant and or call from it. Since you are mainly
          looking at the screen, you won&#39;t have any social
          conversations with other people. The only contact with
          people would be at the place you are going to. GPS costs
          can vary from $100-$300. You might think this is a lot,
          but it cost $12 billion to put a satellite into space.
          Some environmental impacts could be the satellite going
          into space. In many years, it could become space junk.
        </p>
        
		<h1 id="gps2">Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I will have to say that the GPS is a good
          choice. The GPS may cost a lot, but the cost is a
          one-time payment. For a paper map, we will have to keep
          cutting our trees to get it. Also, the GPS has many
          features, such as: Bluetooth, Calling, Recents etc. On a
          paper map, you will forget which way you were holding the
          paper or what direction you were going in. The GPS also
          allows you to book at restaurants. Overall, the GPS is
          much more advanced and more user-friendly.
